I created a user-centered website all about Ohio! As a front-end developer, I needed to structure the content using HTML, while CSS and JavaScript helped design and enhance the layout for different devices.
Since consistency is key in web design, it was important that every page followed the same layout, keeping the user experience smooth and visually appealing.
Throughout this task, I highlighted Ohioâ€™s rich history, industries, landmarks, and cultural significance. My goal was to make the site engaging and accessible, showcasing everything that makes Ohio unique while demonstrating my skills in front-end development.

** Please only view in desktop mode as the site is not mobile responsive!!! This is a school project that did not require mobile responsiveness. **
